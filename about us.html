			  <p>I am Sibusiso Nondoda, I grew up in Port St Johns. I have studied a BSc undergraduate degree <br>
     			 in computer science in an attempt to become a buisness analyst or systems analyst. Therefore, my <br> 
				 undergraduate studies focused on computer, economics and mathematical statistics. However, after being <br>
				 accepted at the cortex hub, I felt more drawn to being an Entrepreneur, and therefore <b> I'm looking <br>
				 forward to create the next big thing </b>.<br>
